# ü©∏ Plasmyrage

**Peripheral blood smear in motion.**  
An interactive histology-inspired simulation of red blood cells, platelets, and leukocytes coursing through a capillary lumen ‚Äî with neutrophils actively engaging invading bacteria. Built in HTML5 Canvas with smooth UI transitions.

## üî¨ Features
- Dynamic simulation of:
  - Erythrocytes (RBCs) with biconcave morphology  
  - Platelets (thrombocytes) as irregular fragments  
  - Neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes with nucleus detail  
  - Bacteria drifting and being engulfed by neutrophils  
- Clickable cells ‚Üí pop-up info with key histology facts  
- Side panel with extended **Ross Histology Atlas**-style notes  
- Animated vessel background for immersion  
- Smooth transitions between menu, simulation, and goodbye screen

Future Ideas
Add eosinophils & basophils for full leukocyte set
Toggle between healthy vs. pathological smears
Zoom-in ultrastructure view (electron micrograph style)
